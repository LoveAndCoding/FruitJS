#FruitJS

FruitJS (pronounced Fruit Juice) is a simple yet powerful converter to turn markdown
into HTML pages. It was created for the purpose of writing technical documentation
and API information in Markdown, and then converting it to a live site. FruitJS is
built on Node.js and can be used as an include or as a command line tool.
